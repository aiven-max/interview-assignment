# Aiven Interview Assignment
For Senior Solution Architect (Post-Sale)

## Repository content
1. "Aiven Kafka Quickstart with Python.docx" - Blog Post about "Aiven Kafka Quickstart with Python".
2. "aiven-kafka-producer.py" - Python script implementing producer that writes messages to Aiven Kafka Service.
3. "aiven-kafka-consumer.py" - Python script implementing consumer that reads messages from Aiven Kafka Service. I had to develop it because viewing messages from Aiven Web Console like described by this link (https://aiven.io/blog/kafka-messages-ui-announcement) is not availale to me for some reason. Not sure why. Maybe UI has changed... Not sure.
4. "ca.cer", "service.cert", "service.key" SSL certs are required to run the code and need to be downloaded from Aiven's account for specific Kafka service.
